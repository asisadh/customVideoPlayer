CustomVideoPlayer

## Getting Started

This project contains an illustration on how can we create a custom player in iOS using swift language. 
Currenlty it loads the default videos saved in the directory, but the overall project is designed to be easily implemented
under a streaming service.

### Major Features
  - fetch the list of available videos
  - detail view where video is actually played
  - list of other recommended video in detail view
  - small mini playback view in the main page, while searching through the video
  - implemented using VIPER pattern
